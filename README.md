# üß† KNN-from-scratch

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm from scratch, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries such as `scikit-learn`. It's designed as a learning exercise to understand the internal mechanics of KNN.

## üìä Dataset

We use the classic **Iris dataset**, a multi-class classification problem involving three species of iris flowers based on four features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

## üöÄ Features

- Custom implementation of the KNN algorithm
- Distance calculation (e.g., Euclidean)
- Handling of real-world data
- Clean and educational Jupyter notebook

## üß™ How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in `notebooks/Knn_from_scratch.ipynb`.
3. Run all cells to see how the KNN algorithm works from the ground up.

## üìö Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This implementation is for educational purposes only and may not be optimized for production use.
